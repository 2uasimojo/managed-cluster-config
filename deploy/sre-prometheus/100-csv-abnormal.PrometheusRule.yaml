# Currently there is a bug in OLM that prevents some of SRE operators from being upgraded
# https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1843184
# The CSV will get stuck in a "Replacing" phase
# The "Replacing" phase will happen during normal operator upgrades. These are accounted for
# by the waiting 30m before warning.
# At 4 hrs, SRE should investigate to ensure operators are being properly upgraded by OLM
