# managed-cluster-config repository

This repo contains static configuration specific to a "managed" OpenShift Dedicated (OSD) cluster.

## How to use this repo

To add a new SelectorSyncSet, add your yaml manifest to the `deploy` dir, then run the `make` command.

# Selector Sync Sets included in this repo

## Prometheus

A set of rules and alerts that SRE requires to ensure a cluster is functioning.  There are two categories of rules and alerts found here:

1. SRE specific, will never be part of OCP
2. Temporary addition until made part of OCP

## Prometheus and Alertmanager persistent storage

Persistent storage is configured using the configmap `cluster-monitoring-config`, which is read by the cluster-monitoring-operator to generate PersistentVolumeClaims and attach them to the Prometheus and Alertmanager pods.

## SRE Authorization

Instead of SRE having `cluster-admin` a new ClusterRole is created with some permissions removed.  The ClusterRole can be regenerated in the `generate/sre-authorization` directory.
